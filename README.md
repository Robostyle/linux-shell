This contains my .zshrc file.

The nvim configuration I use is cloned from https://github.com/rafi/vim-config.

Other tools that that are needed are:

- nvm (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm, just follow the install instructions).
- oh-my-zsh (https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh), plugins:
  - powerlevel10k
